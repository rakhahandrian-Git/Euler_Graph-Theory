6     (E, D)      5        [+] ACCEPTED
      -> Minimum-weight edge crossing the cut (tree=['A', 'B', 'C', 'E', 'F', 'G'] | rest). Frontier considered: (B-D: 7), (E-D: 5)

Total MST Weight: 32
```

**Note on the trace format:** unlike Kruskal's algorithm, Prim's does not need
a per-edge cycle check across the whole edge list. At every step it only
looks at the current **cut** (the edges crossing between the tree so far
and the remaining vertices) and takes the cheapest one — that edge can
never form a cycle, by the Cut Property. This is why the table above has
exactly 6 rows (`V - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6`) instead of listing all 12 edges: each
row already represents an accepted edge, with the full frontier it beat
shown in the reason column for transparency.

### Fail Adaptation

#### Scenario 1: Critical Link Failure (Edge (G, F) severed)
```text
================================================================================
  ADAPTATION REPORT: G-F SEVERED
================================================================================
Failed Nodes : None
Failed Edges : [('G', 'F')]
Active Nodes : 7 (A, B, C, D, E, F, G)

--- Quantitative Impact ---
Baseline MST Cost : 32 (Edges: 6)
Adapted Graph Cost: 33 (Edges: 6)
Cost Difference   : +1

--- Structural Comparison ---
Retained Baseline Edges (5): [A-G: 5, A-C: 6, C-B: 5, D-E: 5, E-F: 5]
Added Replacement Edges (1): [B-D: 7]
Removed / Lost Edges    (1): [G-F: 6]

--- Algorithmic Adaptation Mechanism ---
Status: [SUCCESS] Fully connected Minimum Spanning Tree preserved.
- The cut previously bridged by (G, F) had to be reconnected through a new frontier edge.
- Prim's algorithm re-scanned the frontier and found (B, D) with weight 7 as the new minimum crossing edge.
- Total adapted cost across active nodes is 33.
================================================================================
```

#### Scenario 2: Junction Node Failure (Hub Node C destroyed)
```text
================================================================================
  ADAPTATION REPORT: NODE C DESTROYED
================================================================================
Failed Nodes : ['C']
Failed Edges : None
Active Nodes : 6 (A, B, D, E, F, G)

--- Quantitative Impact ---
Baseline MST Cost : 32 (Edges: 6)
Adapted Graph Cost: 28 (Edges: 5)
Cost Difference   : -4

--- Structural Comparison ---
Retained Baseline Edges (4): [A-G: 5, G-F: 6, F-E: 5, E-D: 5]
Added Replacement Edges (1): [A-B: 7]
Removed / Lost Edges    (2): [A-C: 6, C-B: 5]

--- Algorithmic Adaptation Mechanism ---
Status: [SUCCESS] Fully connected Minimum Spanning Tree preserved.
- All 4 edges incident to 'C' were removed from consideration.
- Prim's algorithm re-scanned the frontier and found (A, B) with weight 7 as the new minimum crossing edge.
- Total adapted cost across active nodes is 28.
================================================================================
```

**Cross-check with Kruskal's results:** both algorithms report identical
adapted costs (33 for the G-F edge failure, 28 for the node-C failure).
This is expected — a minimum spanning tree's *total weight* is the same
no matter which correct MST algorithm produces it, even when the specific
edges chosen along the way differ.
